## Agenda

1. Context and goals
2. Common data formats
3. Work with `csv` and `json`

## Why data structuration

- Any application produces and/or consumes data
- Other applications may depend on this data
- Easier and more **efficient** with a well-defined data structure

## Example system

![](resources/diagrams/example-system.png)

## Common data formats

::: {.incremental}
- Plain text (_e.g._ `json`, `yaml`)
- Fixed-length buffers
- Delimiter-based buffers (_e.g._ `csv`)
- Markup-based buffers (_e.g._ `xml`)
:::

## Plain text files

```{.plain}
January
February
March
April
May
June
July
August
September
October
November
December
```

**Exercise 1**

>  Read the `months.txt` file and store it into a list of strings

## Fixed-length buffers

```{.plain}
0001Pierre                    Paris                         EPITA                         
```

Each element of the buffer has a fixed length.

[0001]{style="color:#E14D2A;"}[Pierre....................]{style="color:#FD841F;"}[Paris.........................]{style="color:#3E6D9C;"}[EPITA.........................]{style="color:#001253;"}

- [0-3: id]{style="color:#E14D2A;"}
- [4-30: name]{style="color:#FD841F;"}
- [31-60: city]{style="color:#3E6D9C;"}
- [61-90: school]{style="color:#001253;"}

We can split the buffer and extract each part with knowledge of the schema.

**Exercise 2**

>  Read the `users.txt` file and store it into a list of class instances

## CSV format (1/2)

The CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format has been in use for a very long time (since the 1970's !)

It is ubiquitous in tech:

- many databases can import/export from/to CSV
- many Unix commands (`cut`, `awk`, etc.) can split on commas -> basic CSV handling
- many text editors and IDEs offer some support for CSV

**But also outside of tech**: spreadsheets (Excel, Libreoffice, etc.) are, functionally, CSV files*

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* disclaimer: `.xslx` files are not actually CSV files

## CSV format (2/2)

```.{plain}
id,name,city,school
0001,Pierre,Paris,EPITA
0002,Ada,London,Home
0003,Margaret,Boston,MIT
```

::: {.incremental}

- No real standard but a set of conventions.
- Each row is an individual record where values are separated by -- usually -- commas, hence the name.
- The first row is usually a header containing the name of the fields.
- Field values can be empty, _e.g._

:::

. . .

```.{plain}
id,name,city,age,school
0001,Pierre,Paris,36,EPITA
0002,Ada,London,,Home
0003,Margaret,Boston,,MIT
```

## CSV exercises

**Exercise 3**

>  Read the `users.csv` file and store it into a list of class instances

. . .

**Exercise 4**

>  Read the `users.csv` file using the `csv` package and store it into a list of class instances

. . .

**Exercise 5**

>  Read the `ratp.csv` file using the `csv` package and standardize the names

RATP data coming from their [open data datasets](https://data.ratp.fr/explore/dataset/trafic-annuel-entrant-par-station-du-reseau-ferre-2021/information/).

## JSON format (1/3)

::: {.incremental}

- JSON = **`J`**`ava`**`S`**`cript `**`O`**`bject `**`N`**`otation`
- more recent but also ubiquitous data format
- originated with Javascript but can be used in virtually every language
- one of the -- if not **the** -- most used format to exchange data between services
- used extensively in REST APIs (more on this topic later)
- unlike CSV, supports data types

:::

## JSON format (2/3)

A JSON document is a collection of key-value pairs, _e.g._

```{.json}
{
  "id": "0001",
  "name": "Pierre",
  "city": "Paris",
  "school": "EPITA",
  "age": 36,
  "is_teacher": true
}
```

. . .

Keys need to be in double-quotes and values can take one of several data types:

::: {.incremental}

- string: _e.g_ `"name": "Pierre"`
- number: _e.g._ `"age": 36`
- boolean: _e.g._ `"is_teacher": true`
- object: a collection of `key-value` pairs inside curly brackets -- `{ }`. The example above is itself an object -> JSON allows nested objects
- array: an ordered list of zero or more elements, each of which may be of any type, inside square brackets -- `[ ]`

:::

## JSON format (3/3)

Can be written on one-line as well

```{.json}
{"id": "0001", "name": "Pierre", "city": "Paris", "school": "EPITA", "age": 36, "is_teacher": true}
```

. . .

By standard, a JSON document must contain only one object at the top-level, or an array of objects, _e.g._ these two documents are valid:

. . .

```{.json}
{
  "id": "0001",
  "name": "Pierre",
  "city": "Paris",
  "school": "EPITA",
  "age": 36,
  "is_teacher": true
}
```

```{.json}
[
  {"id": "0001", "name": "Pierre", "city": "Paris", "school": "EPITA", "age": 36, "is_teacher": true},
  {"id": "0002", "name": "Ada", "city": "London", "school": "Home", "age": 28, "is_teacher": false}
]
```

. . .

However, this one is invalid:

```{.json}
{"id": "0001", "name": "Pierre", "city": "Paris", "school": "EPITA", "age": 36, "is_teacher": true}
{"id": "0002", "name": "Ada", "city": "London", "school": "Home", "age": 28, "is_teacher": false}
```

. . . 

**Except** that there is a use case for this type of JSON documents -- called line-delimited JSON or JSONL: storing log files, so many libraries can actually read these documents.

## JSON exercises

**Exercise 6**

>  Read the `users.json` file, store it into a list of class instances and compare them with the ones created from the CSV file.
